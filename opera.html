        The Picture Gallery in Ruddigore Castle<br>

       Scene.—Picture Gallery in Ruddigore Castle.  The walls are
       covered with full-length portraits of the Baronets of
       Ruddigore from the time of James I.—the first being that of
       Sir Rupert, alluded to in the legend; the last, that of the
       last deceased Baronet, Sir Roderic.

    <pre>
        DUET—ROBIN and ADAM.

ROB.           I once was as meek as a new-born lamb,
                   I'm now Sir Murgatroyd—ha! ha!
                        With greater precision
                        (Without the elision),
                    Sir Ruthven Murgatroyd—ha! ha!
      
ADAM.          And I, who was once his valley-de-sham,
                    As steward I'm now employed—ha! ha!
                         The dickens may take him—
                         I'll never forsake him!
                    As steward I'm now employed—ha! ha!
    
BOTH.       How dreadful when an innocent heart
            Becomes, perforce, a bad young Bart.,
            And still more hard on old Adam,
            His former faithful valley-de-sham!

CHORUS.        For she is such, etc.

ROSE.          My hopes will be blighted, I fear,
                                My dear;
                 In a month you'll be going to sea,
                                Quite free,
                      And all of my wishes
                      You'll throw to the fishes
                 As though they were never to be;
                                Poor me!
                 As though they were never to be.
                 And I shall be left all alone
                                To moan,
                 And weep at your cruel deceit,
                                Complete;
                      While you'll be asserting
                      Your freedom by flirting
                 With every woman you meet,
                                You cheat—Ah!
                 With every woman you meet! Ah!

                 Though I am such a smart little craft—
                 Such a neat little, sweet little craft,
                      Such a bright little, tight little,
                      Slight little, light little,
                 Trim little, prim little craft!

SIR ROD.       Beware! beware! beware!

ROB.                Gaunt vision, who art thou
                 That thus, with icy glare
                      And stern relentless brow,
                      Appearest, who knows how?
