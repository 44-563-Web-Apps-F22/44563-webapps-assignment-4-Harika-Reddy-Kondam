    <pre>
        DUET—ROBIN and ADAM.

<h6 class="name"> ROB.</h6>
<p class="song ROB"> 
I once was as meek as a new-born lamb,
I'm now Sir Murgatroyd—ha! ha!
With greater precision</p>
<p class="direction"> (Without the elision)</p>
<p class="song ROB"> ,Sir Ruthven Murgatroyd—ha! ha!</p>
      
<h6 class="name">ADAM.</h6>         
<p class="song ADAM">
And I, who was once his valley-de-sham,
As steward I'm now employed—ha! ha!
The dickens may take him—
I'll never forsake him!
As steward I'm now employed—ha! ha!</p>
    
<h6 class="name">BOTH.</h6>           
<p class="song BOTH">
How dreadful when an innocent heart
Becomes, perforce, a bad young Bart.,
And still more hard on old Adam,
His former faithful valley-de-sham!</p>

<h6 class="name">CHORUS.</h6>        
<p class="speech CHORUS">For she is such, etc.</p>

<h6 class="name">ROSE.</h6>        
 <p class="song ROSE">
My hopes will be blighted, I fear,
My dear;
In a month you'll be going to sea,
Quite free,
And all of my wishes
You'll throw to the fishes
As though they were never to be;
Poor me!
As though they were never to be.
And I shall be left all alone
To moan,
And weep at your cruel deceit,
Complete;
While you'll be asserting
Your freedom by flirting
With every woman you meet,
You cheat—Ah!
With every woman you meet! Ah!

Though I am such a smart little craft—
Such a neat little, sweet little craft,
Such a bright little, tight little,
Slight little, light little,
Trim little, prim little craft!</p>

<h6 class="name">SIR_ROD.</h6>       
<p class="speech SIR_ROD">Beware! beware! beware!</p>

<h6 class="name">ROB.</h6>                 
<p class="song ROB">
Gaunt vision, who art thou
That thus, with icy glare
And stern relentless brow,
Appearest, who knows how?</p>
